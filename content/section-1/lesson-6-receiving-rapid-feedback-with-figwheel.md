# Lesson 6: Receiving Rapid Feedback With Figwheel

In the last lesson, we only executed one command, but we already have a basic
project that will compile, and as we will see in a moment, automatically reload.
Figwheel is the tool of choice in the ClojureScript community for reloading code
and executing ClojureScript code inside a web browser. Interactive development
has been a huge priority for ClojureScript developers, and the instant feedback
afforded by a tool like Figwheel delivers on making development a truly
interactive experience.

*In this lesson:*

- Learn how interactive development is a cornerstone of ClojureScript
- Use Figwheel to compile and load it into the browser instantly
- Learn how to write reloadable code

In order to better understand how Figwheel can streamline development, let's fire
it up and see it in action. Since we generated a project using the Figwheel template
for Leiningen, it included the `lein-figwheel` plugin, which lets us start Figwheel
with a single command.

```
$ cd cljs-weather                                          # <1>
$ lein figwheel                                            # <2>
Retrieving lein-figwheel/lein-figwheel/0.5.0-6/lein-figwheel-0.5.0-6.pom from clojars
# ... More output ...

```

_Running Figwheel with Leiningen_

1. Enter the project directory
2. Start Figwheel

Figwheel will take a few seconds to start up and compile the existing code, but
once the output indicates that Figwheel is ready to connect to our application,
we can open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3449` and see the
running application.

_Reloading ClojureScript with Figwheel_

What happens when we start Figwheel is that it begins watching our project for
any changes to the ClojureScript source files. When any of these files are
changed, Figwheel compiles them to JavaScript, sends the JavaScript to the
browser, and executes it. What sets this type of development apart from
most JavaScript code reloading code is that it will

## Testing Live Reloading

Now that we have an application running with Figwheel reloading code on any
change, we can open a text editor and change some of the code. The Leiningen
template that we used generated a single source file at
`src/cljs_weather/core.cljs` by default, and we will restrict the exercises in
this lesson to this single file. Before we make any changes, let's walk through
the contents of this file at a high level.

```clojure
(ns cljs-weather.core                                      ;; <1>
  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent :refer [atom]]))

(enable-console-print!)                                    ;; <2>

(println "Edits to this text should show up in your developer console.")

;; define your app data so that it doesn't get over-written on reload

(defonce app-state (atom {:text "Hello world!"}))          ;; <3>

(defn hello-world []                                       ;; <4>
  [:h1 (:text @app-state)])

(reagent/render-component [hello-world]
                          (. js/document (getElementById "app")))


(defn on-js-reload []                                      ;; <5>
  ;; optionally touch your app-state to force rerendering depending on
  ;; your application
  ;; (swap! app-state update-in [:__figwheel_counter] inc)
)
```

_src/cljs\_weather/core.cljs_

1. Namespace declaration
2. Allow print statements to go to the JavaScript console
3. Data structure to hold all UI state
4. Declare and render a Reagent component
6. Optional hook into Figwheel's reloading process

Let's start by making a minor change to the `hello-world` component. We will add
a bit of extra text to it just to make sure that our changes are picked up:


```clojure
(defn hello-world []
  [:h1 "I say: " (:text @app-state)])
```

Once we save the file, we should quickly see the browser update to reflect the
extra text that we added. Next, let's do something slightly more interesting by
changing the text inside `app-state` to something other than "Hello World!":

```clojure
(defonce app-state (atom {:text "Live reloading rocks!"}))
```

If we save the file again, we'll see that nothing in the browser changes. The
reason that nothing changed is that we are using `defonce` to create the
`app-state`. Using `defonce` ensures that whenever the `cljs-weather.core`
namespace is reloaded, `app-state` is not touched. This behaviour can give us a
large productivity boost. Consider the scenario of building a multi-page form
with some complex validation rules. If we were working on the validation for the
last page in the form, we would normally make a change to the code, reload the
browser, then fill in the form until we got to the last page, test our changes,
and repeat the cycle as many times as necessary until we had everything to our
liking. With ClojureScript and Figwheel on the other hand, we can fill in the
first few pages of the form then make small changes to the code while observing
the effects immediately. Since the app state would not get reset when our code
is re-loaded, we would never have to repeat the tedious cycle of filling out the
earlier pages.

### You Try

- Change the `hello-world` component to render a `<p>` tag instead
- Create a new component called `greeter` that renders, "Hello, <YOUR_NAME>"
  and update the call to `reagent/render-component` to use `greeter` instead of
  `hello-world`.

In addition to reloading ClojureScript code, Figwheel also takes care of
reloading any stylesheets that we may change as well. The Figwheel Leiningen
template that we used when creating this project configure Figwheel to watch any
styles in the `resources/public/css` directory for changes. To test this out, we
will open the default (empty) stylesheet and add a couple of styles:

```css
body {
  background-color: #02A4FF;
  color: #ffffff;
}

h1 {
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 300;
}
```

_resources/public/css/style.css_

Upon saving the stylesheet, Figwheel will send the new stylesheet to the browser
and apply it without a full page load. The ability to instantly receive feedback
on any ClojureScript or CSS change can lead to a very productive workflow.

## Writing Reloadable Code

Having Figwheel reload your code is a great help, but it is not magic - we
are still responsible for writing code that can be reloaded without adversely
affecting the behaviour of our application. Later in
this book, we will be building several applications on React.js and a
ClojureScript wrapper called Reagent, which strongly encourage a style
of coding that is conducive to live reloading, but we should still
familiarize ourselves with what makes reloadable code so that we can
still take full advantage of live reloading whether we are using one
of these frameworks or not.

There are many considerations that go into writing reloadable code,
but they essentially boil down to three key concepts, which we will
consider as the "Pillars of Reloadable Code": idempotent functions,
`defonce`, and display/business logic segregation.

![The Pillars of Reloadable Code](/img/lesson6/reloadable-pillars.png)

_The Pillars of Reloadable Code_

When we write code that holds to these three pillars, we will often
find that not only do we end up with reloadable code, but our code
often ends up being much more robust and maintainable as well. With
that, we'll dig into each of these pillars and how to apply them to
our code.

### Idempotent Functions

An idempotent function is a function that will have the same effect whether it
is called once or many times. For instance, a function that sets the `innerHTML`
property of a DOM element is idempotent, but a function that appends an child
to some other element is not:

#### Idempotent and Non-Idempotent Functions

```clojure
(defn append-element [parent child]                        ;; <1>
  (.appendChild parent child))

(defn set-content [elem content]                           ;; <2>
  (aset elem "innerHTML" content))
```

1. Non-idempotent function
2. Idempotent function

The `append-element` function is definitely not idempotent because the effect
will be different when we call it 100 times than when we call it once. The
`set-content` function, on the other hand, is idempotent - no matter how many
times we call it, the result is going to be the same. When working with live
reloading, we should make sure that any function that is called on reload is
idempotent, otherwise

#### You Try It

- Write a version of `append-element` that is idempotent and will only append
the child if it doesn't already exist. A possible solution is given below:

```clojure
(defn append-element [parent child]
  (when-not (.contains parent child)
    (.appendChild parent child)))
```

### `defonce`

When we have scaffolded a Figwheel project with the `--reagent` flag, the
namespace that it generates uses a construct called `defonce` to define the
application state:

```clojure
(defonce app-state (atom {:text "Hello world!"}))
```

As we mentioned above, `defonce` is very similar to `def`, but as its
name suggests, it only binds the var once, effectively ignoring the expression
on subsequent evaluations. We often define our app state with `defonce` so that
it is not overwritten by a fresh value every time our code is reloaded. In this
way, we can preserve the state of the application along with any transient data
while the business logic of our application is reloaded.

Another useful pattern for using defonce is to protect initialization code from
running repeatedly. A `defonce` expression takes the form: `(defonce name expr)`
where `name` is a symbol that names the var to bind and `expr` is any
ClojureScript expression. Not only does `defonce` prevent the var from being
redefined, it also prevents `expr` from being re-evaluated when the var is
bound. This means that we can wrap initialization code with a `defonce` to
guarantee that it will only be evaluated once regardless of how often the code
is reloaded:

```clojure
(defonce is-initialized?
  (do                                                      ;; <1>
    (.setItem js/localStorage "init-at" (.now Date))
    (js/alert "Welcome!")
    true))                                                 ;; <2>
```

_Wrapping Initialization Code_

1. `do` evaluates multiple expressions and takes on the value of the last expression
2. Bind `is-initialized?` to `true` once the set-up is complete

In this case, we defined a var called `is-initialized?` that is only evaluated
once and is bound to the value `true` once all initialization is complete. This
is the first time that we have seen the `do` form. `do` evaluates each
expression that is passed to it and returns the value of the final expression.
It is useful when there are side effects that we want to perform (in this case,
setting a value in `localStorage` and displaying an alert) before finally
yielding some value. Combining `do` with `defonce` is a common pattern for
ensuring that certain code will run only one time.

### Quick Review

- While Figwheel is running, find the line in `core.cljs` that contains, `(defonce app-state ...)`, change the text, and save the file. Does the page update? Why or why not?
- Find the line in `core.cljs` that contains `[:h1 (:text @app-state)]` and change the `h1` to `p`. Does the page update? Why is this behavior different from changing the definition of `app-state`?

### Display/Business Logic Separation

The separation of display code and business logic is good practice in general,
but it is even more important for reloadable code. Recall the `append-element`
function that we wrote several pages back when discussing idempotent functions.
Consider that we were writing a Twitter-like application and used this function
to append a new message to some feed. There are a couple of ways in which we
could write this code, but not all of them are conducive to live reloading.
Consider the following code, which does not separate the logic of receiving a
new message from displaying it:

```clojure
(defn receive-message [text timestamp]
  (let [node (.createElement js/document "div")]
    (aset node "innerHTML" (str "[" timestamp "]: " text))
    (.appendChild messages-feed node)))
```

_Combining Display and Business Logic_

In this example, we combine the logic of processing an incoming message with the
concern of displaying the message. Now let's say that we want to simplify the UI
by removing the timestamp from the display. with this code, we would have to
modify the `receive-message` function to omit the timestamp then refresh the
browser, since our new code would not affect any messages already rendered. A
better alternative would be something like the following:

```clojure
(defonce messages (atom []))                               ;; <1>

(defn receive-message [text timestamp]                     ;; <2>
  (swap! messages conj {:text text :timestamp timestamp}))

(defn render-all-messages! [messages]                      ;; <3>
  (aset messages-feed "innerHTML" "")
  (doseq [message @messages]
    (let [node (.createElement js/document "div")]
      (aset node "innerHTML" (str "[" timestamp "]: " text))
      (.appendChild messages-feed node))))

(render-all-messages!)                                     ;; <4>
```

_Separating Display and Business Logic_

1. All messages received are stored in a `defonce`'d atom that will not be overwritten
2. The function that handles new messages is pure business logic
3. The function that renders messages is pure display logic
4. Perform a render

In this case, we could update the `render-all-messages!` function, and when
Figwheel reloaded our code, the messages list would remain untouched, but the
display function would behave differently, and when `render-all-messages!` is
called, the display for all messages would be updated.

*NOTE:* The implementation of the above code is inefficient, since the entire list
is re-rendered every time we call `render-all-messages!`. In later lessons, we
will use the Reagent framework to achieve similar results much more efficiently.

### Quick Review

- What are the pillars of reloadable code? Why is each one of these important?
- What is the difference between `def` and `defonce`?

### You Try

- With Figwheel running, try changing the text inside the `app-state` and saving the file. What happens? Would something different have happened if we had used `def` instead of `defonce`?
- Introduce a syntax error in the code and see what happens in the browser.

## Summary

In this lesson, we examined a core feature of interactive development in
ClojureScript - live reloading. We used Figwheel to reload our code whenever it
changed, and we looked at the principles behind writing code that is reloadable.
Equipped with this knowledge, we can take our productivity to the next level and
enjoy much quicker feedback than we normally get with JavaScript. We now know:

- How to start Figwheel from the command line
- How Figwheel reloads code when it changes
- How to write code that is conducive to reloading
