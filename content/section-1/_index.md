# Section 1: Tools of the Trade

ClojureScript is a very productive and efficient language. While these features stem largely
from the language itself, ClojureScript owes quite a bit of its productivity to the tools
and common practices that have developed around it (and its Lisp predecessors over the past
few decades). While there are some code samples and exercises in this section - including a
simple but complete application in [Lesson 8](/section-1/lesson-8-capstone-weather-forecasting-app) -
the focus is on learning the tools that will make you an effective ClojureScript programmer.
Just as a new JavaScript developer needs a basic understanding of Babel and Webpack, and the
browser dev tools, a new ClojureScript developer ought to have a famialiarity with the tools that
we cover in this section.

Now that we have a high-level perspective on ClojureScript as a language and is place in
the JavaScript ecosystem, we will walk through the process of bootstrapping a new ClojureScript
project, using Leiningen, the defacto Clojure and ClojureScript build tool. Next, we will introduce
Figwheel, an invaluable tool for live-reloading code and styles, and we will learn how to write code
that is conducive to reloable live reloading. Then, we will introduce the REPL - an extremely powerful
tool for experimenting with small snippets of code. Finally, we will use these tools to create a
weather forecasting app that showcases leiningen templates and live reloading. This project is intended
to convey a taste of the process of developing ClojureScript rather than giving a deep understanding of
the code. Don't worry though - in the following section, we will begin our exploration of the language
itself!
